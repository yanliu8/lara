Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.\n\nI easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  \n\nWhen my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \n\nIn case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"We need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.\n\nA few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.

We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.\nWe arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.\nInside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\nThe waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\nAfter reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \nHis bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\nThe Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\nEverything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\nMy only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.\nIt usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.\nCoffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.\nWhile I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-13", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "Dg9xy4ZbsteCBUL_sjaNKA", "review_id": "LTHhgovWBAXquOrDVKx3Yw", "text": "Met my nephew for lunch in Carnegie and he suggested Gab & Eat.   Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!

What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \"Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying!

I had to carefully drink the beverage - which was OK - because I was afraid that I would get the syrup all over my hand, face, and clothes.

It's too bad cos I generally judge a place by the quality of their breakfast potatoes but in this case the fried chicken more than made up for it.

I can still find some sort of fruit in grocery store that's decent and you're a major chain! Find a supplier. What really was disappointing was that my server up-charged me 1.99 for less-than-half-cup. Now I have worked in the past for many years. Yes, some swaps do require an additional charge, but really? I just gave you back potatoes and toast for clear fruit. She did take it off, but I'm sure she was doing what is practice.

My husband and I were riding the bike trail in Pittsburgh and we decided to grab a bite to eat here since this location is right along the trail.  We noticed there were many tables open on the patio so we requested to sit outside.  It was rather busy inside so we waited patiently for 20 minutes until it was our turn to be seated.  The hostess then took us to a table inside the restaurant.  Not wanting to be rude, I asked if they were not putting anyone outside for some reason... She said the person who took our name didn't indicate that we wanted to sit outside (however, I watched her write \"patio\" next to our name).  We were then led outside and told to sit where ever we wanted... Because it was still basically empty... \n\nFinally happy to be seated, we waited another 10 minutes or so for our waitress to come.  She asked if we were ready to order both our meals and drinks so we did.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks which we quickly drank because we were thirsty from riding.  We were able to get a refill before we got our food since it took over 40 minutes from the time we ordered it.  The waitress came back one more time after we were done eating and I asked it I could talk to someone about how long everything took but she did not seem interested.  No apology.   Nothing.  She simply said that sometimes they aren't told when someone is seated outside.  Maybe that would explain the initial wait but why the terrible service after she clearly knew we were there?\n\nThis Eat'n Park is a joke.  Extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it.  The food was ok, but paying for that meal made me feel like I was being robbed.  A group of people at the table next to us walked out after waiting 10-15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge them.  Even when a woman at the table asked our waitress if she could order drinks, she just went inside and ignored them.

Half the table had Pepsi or Diet Pepsi, the other half had water and two people had dr. pepper.

Janee did stop and take a picture of our whole table which was nice and we were there three hours so she did earn her pay, but she set the expectation high that she knew what she was doing and it fell flat pretty fast.

Friday's is a T.G.I. Friday's. You either like it or hate it. This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash-up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid-back lounge feel and there's nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise (and like other Friday's, it's not particularly easy to eat here if you're anything other than a meat lover).\n\nHonestly I wasn't expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group (as it says on the T.G.I. Friday's website that it's ideal to call ahead when you have a large party). However, I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations. So my friends and I looked elsewhere, and finally walked across the street to Friday's after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were. At least Friday's only had a 15 minute wait.\n\nOnce we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully. I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us, but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen. Kudos. The food, as I mentioned earlier, was standard T.G.I.Friday's. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not that exciting either. I had actually found one of the only low-calorie items on the menu at the last minute - a steak and vegetable dish - and standard or not I was honestly pretty happy with it. My steak was surprisingly juicy, came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all (I'd ordered a medium temperature steak), and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu. Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail, which mixed so much rum, fruit juice, sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head. It was worth it, though - that drink was a sweet, tall cup of Heaven.\n\nThis T.G.I.Friday's really fits my exact definition of an \"a-ok\" place - it's not terrible, nor is it not exceptional. It's just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink.

He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8.

Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.\n\nThe place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  \n\nThe menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.\n\nThe service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.\n\nOverall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.

I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.\n\nI will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.\n\nSo I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. \n\nI went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\n\nSo I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying \"Soooo, you DON'T want these???\" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! \n\nAfter that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). \n\nThe thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras.

Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because \"your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen.

Unfortunately a great deal of what is on their regular menu and with the delivery services is comprised of the American version  of Chinese food.The first time I came to this place they only gave me the American iced menu.But having lived in the Bay Area for many years I scoped out the Hong Kong style menu and vowed to order from it the next time I went to Tasty and I did.Now I just  pick up the Hong Kong menu automatically when I come in.Their Hong Kong dishes are some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh.The garlic eggplant in a velvety sauce combines the right hint of spiciness with sweet and virtually melts in your mouth.The salted squid (what's usually known as salt and pepper squid) has a light, crispy coating with a minimum of oil and the texture of the squid is\njust a tiny bit chewy but not too much so.Texture in squid is a daunting thing to get just right.I am a Chow Fun freak anyway  but their shrimp chow fun with egg sauce is the best I've ever tasted with slightly charred noodles fresh dhrimp and a wonderful egg scramble sauce . Recently I had a friend visiting from San Francisco and took him here (kind of a test to see if my view of this place was somehow off) and he raved about everything especially this chow fun dish.To sum up,if you want to experience the best of Tasty please order from the Hong Kong menu.Since. I don't order American Chinese dishes here I can't comment on them but I guess the genius of this place is authentic South Chinese dishes (as evidenced by the Chinese families I've seen eating here) not the usual  pseudo Chinese dishes many people seem to order here.I expect the chef/cook here just doesn't have his heart in Crab Rangoon or chow mein.", "business_id": "Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-31", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "dENoFJQbXqeyRmoHLogVzw", "review_id": "gFIsGqYMeZ9Qa_cIjo_7DA", "text": "Eating as I type.

I made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop, and she volunteered some additional information about their production that I found to be very interesting. \n\nI really loved the bistro burger. I requested it to be prepared \"Medium\", and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times I've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. Nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. We also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. I thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. We really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. I was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. My partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which I found to have that \"homemade\" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants.

I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  \n\nMy two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \n\nI ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \n\nThe service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.

We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\n\nThe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.

Although the restuarant is small, the ambiance is wonderful. I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well.\n\nThe table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors.

The prices aren't the cheapest, but for what it is Pino's delivers small plates and dinners that are satisfying without breaking the bank. The lamb bolognese is one of my personal favorites, as well as pretty much any of the appetizers. I also love the creative cocktail list and the half price bottles of wine for happy hour. There are few places in Pittsburgh that can get me as excited about cocktails as Pino's. My roommate and I have come here with friends and sat at the bar for hours eating and drinking a variety of delightful things. In short, they do drinks and food quite well for the price. \n\nThe reason Pino's only gets three stars is the unfortunate inconsistency with service I've encountered. I get treated differently depending on who I come in with, and that's unprofessional. If I'm with my roommate and one of my friends (both of whom work nearby) we all get seated quickly and treated extremely well. In short, it feels like my presence is valued. When I've come to Pino's with people who aren't in with the owners though, I've had a thoroughly lackluster experience. Once I came on my birthday with my boyfriend and frankly was let down. We waited awkwardly for a very long time to be seated even though there were empty tables and in general had a very impersonal experience. I felt embarrassed having spoken so highly of Pino's to him beforehand. I know I'll be back for the occasional happy hour or small dinner, but Pino's isn't somewhere I would take anyone I wanted to impress due to the problematic service.", "business_id": "ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-10", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "9XLRLYTi8MUCFGdlmJQngw", "review_id": "5sGUloki5FLc2Wz5hYlacg", "text": "I normally love Pinos.

I don't know\" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \"Let me check that for you\") he instead said \"Well, I'm going to hang up now.\"  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\n4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \"I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\" to which she responded \"Yeah that should be fine\" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \"Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\" \n10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\n\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \"Effing Men's Wearhouse.\"  For example, at a restaurant, \"Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!\"  \"Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.\"\n\nAnother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \"I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding\" to which I replied \"Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\"\n\nCongrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.\n\nTL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.", "business_id": "DMy5IG-dNrH4ARk96KngEA", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-20", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "fUhlTCJtN4nk74ME5IkSew", "review_id": "rJaGModqXG-FpzaD4T9Lag", "text": "I went in to get my suit that I bought last year tailored because I had lost some weight and I couldn't have had a better experience.

Last year, he also rented a tux there for an out-of-town wedding he was in. After the wedding was over (the next day, before we returned home), we returned the tux to a MW at the local mall, also sans any issues.\n\nRecently, said husband got a promotion and bought some dress pants and shirts from MW at the mall, and was sent a $50 gift card. Last weekend, we decided to head down to The Waterfront....lo and behold, there's a MW in Homestead. Who knew? So, we head to MW to see if he can get something for free. Before we go in, I ask him, how much are pants normally at MW? He said, oh about $50 or $60. Okay, well the cheapest pair of pants we find are around $130, but most around $200?! I'm shocked, never thought men's dress clothes were so pricey. Again, who knew? Surprisingly, we were able to sift through the sale racks and were able to find one pair of pants on sale for $19.99 and dress shirts for $14.99! Very exciting! \n\nThe problem was the staff and the store itself. First of all, the store was messy. Sales racks had clothes out of place and shirts rolled up, not a good impression for a 'high end' men's clothing store, not to mention it was hard to look for sizes etc. with everything out of place.\n\nThe biggest issue was with the staff. There were five employees in the store. Okay, I get it, they work on commission, but seriously. The one and only employee who approached us, and I can't remember her name but she was a middle-aged Russian woman- was a shark! She asked if we need help, we both say no, we're fine. Just looking. I am much more assertive than my husband, however, which she realized right away. Needless to say, she wouldn't leave us alone. I tried several times - nicely - to tell her we were just looking around. My husband said, I'm looking for some dress shirts and pants. maybe a tie. She just doesn't get it...keeps asking \"Do you want to look at more ties?\" \"We have nice blazers and jackets\" I'm finally like, lady we're only here because we have a gift card, we don't plan on spending a ton of money. Getting her to leave us alone was near impossible. If it would have been me alone, I would have walked out. However, I knew my husband wanted to use the gift card.\n\nThe worst part is there were other customers in the store that no one was waiting on. Some of which were looking around for assistance. I didn't get it.\n\nContinuing on, check out was a nightmare! Each and every item rang up more than the price tag. She had to end up cancelling the sale and re-doing the whole thing. We had to carefully scrutinize every thing she rang up, to make sure we weren't overcharged. We ended up going over the $50 - obviously. So, she says, \"You can swipe your card there.\" I said, \"We have cash\" and omg you would have thought it was the end of the world. They had no money in the drawer and she actually had to send another employee in the back to get us change. \n\nLet's just say, I'm sure my hub won't returning here anytime soon. You can buy nice men's clothing almost anywhere else for less money and less hassle. \n\nPros: None", "business_id": "DMy5IG-dNrH4ARk96KngEA", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-06-23", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "ht2ZzPC4G6wGDlbDZTvwEA", "review_id": "c_RkInt5LQR2MteQVvO2mw", "text": "After numerous visits to The Men's Wearhouse throughout the years, I would give this place a thumb's up.

Why would you come to Mitchell's if not for the fish/seafood? You probably wouldn't. But you can swim in the Great Lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).  \nThe food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story).

We were both eating lite since a) I was dieting and b) my family was having dinner at my mother's house and she was slaving over lasagna all day, so if anyone knows anything about Italian mother's, you better arrive hungry. Back to mitchell's, I had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn't overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn't much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn't too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn't a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it's the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than \"cheesy\", it was a great surprise when you're expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. There were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins, which I love. Also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than I've tasted in the past. I highly recommend it.

And actually, if it wasn't a chain, it wouldn't be too bad either.  The atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant - the room was warm and intimate, perfect for a date.  It wasn't too noisy or too crowded, and we were seated right away on a Friday around 7:30 pm.\n\nOur server was friendly, and happy to give recommendations.  I started with a house salad, which I told the server I would split with my boyfriend.  She brought it to us on two separate plates, which I thought was a nice touch, and more than what I expected.  Poppy seed dressing was okay, it's pretty thick and creamy as I remember, but tasty.\n\nI ordered from the special menu, since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on.  My entree was a combo: lobster tail, and \"lobster pot pie.\"  Now, lobster is a beautiful thing, but I have to say....it wasn't beautiful here.  It wasn't awful, but it didn't taste as fresh as I like (I'm guessing that's because the meat was frozen originally).  It's just a shame.  Dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience, but it's supposed to be an ecstatic one.\n\nThe lobster pot pie was totes not what I imagined.  I pictured a flaky, golden crust, a delicious creamy lobstery gravy, and big hunks of lobster and vegetables.  Instead....I got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit.  There was a lot of sauce, which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich, with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg (I'd recognize those tiny square-shaped carrot chunks anywhere)!  Whaaaaaaaat?  It wasn't bad or anything, but not what I imagined.  I was a little bummed out.  \n\nSo everything we ate was just fine, and nice when you're craving seafood....but I think in future I'd rather just head to the Strip, get a lobster, and cook the sucker up myself.  I didn't try their fresh preparations, so I can't say how those were.\n\nI'd say in the Waterfront though, it's probably one of your better options.

The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal.

He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.

Make sure you go with a bunch of guys, because it isn't all you care to eat, it is a challenge.  You have to eat all you can eat and your ego is on the line if you don't.  I once went to Ribs night and one buddy of mine ordered a Buffalo Chicken salad when everyone else ordered ribs.  Yea, he regretted his terrible decision.\n\nAnyways.  The food itself.  The ribs are basic baby back ribs that come in a choice of mild, medium, and hot bbq sauce.  I tend to just go medium, b/c I find a hot bbq sauce covers up the taste of the meat itself, and when I eat ribs I care more about the taste and texture of the actual meat with the sauce being a supporting player.  The ribs are ok for mass produced ribs, nothing spectacular.  The most I've done is only two racks of ribs, but that was only because I didn't want to keep everyone else waiting up for me.  Ribs come in a rack in first round, and then re-orders come by the half rack.\n\nPersonally I prefer wing night, as they have fantastic wings.  Wings come in a dozen in the first round, followed by half dozen reorders until you're done.  They have 12 different flavors, but my favorite ones are Buffalo Blue, Old Yeller, and Red Hot Parm.  Buffalo Blue is a tasty bbq sauce that isn't overly sweet like some of their other bbq sauces, Old Yeller is a Carolina Mustard based sauce, and Red Hot Parm is a traditional Buffalo sauce (Frank's Red Hot + Butter) then topped with Parmesan Cheese.  Their Cool Ranch, Garlic Parm, and Spicy Garlic can be a bit greasy, so if you do order one of those make sure its in a batch of 6 and you share with your friends, I kind of like their Spicy Garlic, but no one else ever wants to split an order with me, oh well.  Their Gold Rush and Death Row are their two other non-spicy bbq sauces, but I prefer Buffalo Blue to both of them.\n\nFor their spicy flavors, there's Red Hot, which is just a traditional Buffalo, there's Howlin' Wolf, which is a spicy sour sauce with pepper seeds on it, and there's Hotter than Hell, which is a spicy bbq sauce.  Personally I find Howlin' Wolf tasty in small quantities, but sometimes the sourness gets to me.  I tend to find spicy bbq sauces a bit funky, so I'm not big on Hotter than Hell.\n\nIf I have a big appetite I eat from 24-30 wings.  If its just a regular day I'll eat around 18-22ish wings.\n\nNote: These wings are huge.  They aren't your typical Wingzone or Quaker Steak and Lube sized wings.  These are real wings from real chickens, not some little baby chicks just hatched from their eggs.\n\nThe rest of the menu is just typical American restaurant food with various sandwiches, a burger option, salad options, etc.\n\nHighly highly recommended.", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-01", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "pMf6ebP3jCkELI8RdUebPw", "review_id": "PKlayH1KWCfUPHeG0RmeyQ", "text": "Living down the street of Buffalo Blues has it's advantages and disadvantages.

We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\n\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.

It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\n\nI went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here.  \n\nI just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.

For me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an NFL game...especially if you're not a Steelers fan. On any given Sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the NFL taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. Seating is the only issue. Get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. Luckily, the TV's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.\n\nThe draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by East End Brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, PBR), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.\n\nAs far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. I've had mostly great service at the bar, but I've also had average to below average service at tables. During bigger sporting events - primarily Steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.\n\nOverall, I have to rate the food as average. I LOVE their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. Their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. The fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. I think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. The menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. It's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.\n\nIn the end, I'm giving Buffalo Blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a \"sports bar.\" As far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. They always get a good crowd for games (whether Sundays during the NFL season, Saturdays during big college games, or for Pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. There's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds I've experience in other sports bars in town. Most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in Shadyside for lunch and dinner.", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-28", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "JEvkfVPf_DuhX-ntE5L6bQ", "review_id": "JXILRnFAOBauVnDibjGrDA", "text": "Superbowl Sunday at the Blues. i came to meet a group of friends to watch the \" who really cares about this game\"  show.

Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.\n\nI'll start with the drinks.  They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM).   Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.\n\nThe menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain.  One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.\n\nI know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars.  This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the \"word versions\" of the ratings that Yelp gives us.  \"A-OK,\" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.  The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.  It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.\n\nTo sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.  Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but \"just fine.\"  But I'm sure I'll go back there for happy hour again sometime.", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-03", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "UFem4aIQoL9MtejCZQ6YDg", "review_id": "hnnT9vXu-m2PZeOKpqX-6Q", "text": "When Hotlick's died, Buffalo blues was born.

This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! \n\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your \"space\" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called \"party room\" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\n\nWant to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!\n\nThe \"wonderful\" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, \"Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!\" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).\n\nThe food: Kinda good.

Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place.

Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving the service one. We didn't eat anything so I can't comment on the food. \n\nMy husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.\n\nThe bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\n\nShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left.

I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. \n\nBuffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\n\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.

The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.  Not even a little bit.

Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.

I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\n\nThey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\n\nThe food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entr\u00e9e, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entr\u00e9e salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.\n\nUpshot?

Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring.

Olive Garden seems like fine dining compared to this place. \n\nYou can already tell how bad your experience is going to be when they give you the complimentary bread that looked like it was bought from a convenience store. Not the crusty Italian bread. The generic Giant Eagle whole wheat bread that I buy regularly tasted 10x better. This so-called Italian bread came with pre-packed airline butter. No dipping oil with herbs and spices. Then we had the wedding soup which looked like it's been sitting in the kitchen since this morning and was just reheated. \n\nWe had the appetizer platter, which was composed of allegedly banana peppers, calamari, and breaded zucchini. It was 95% breading. I can barely taste any calamari or zucchini. The worst was the marinara sauce, which tasted like it came from a can. Again, no herbs and spices. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti. The only way I can describe the sauce is: Think of diluted Ragu. My pasta was also overcooked and there was no flavor whatsoever so I had to put so much parmesan cheese. I couldn't even taste garlic in it. What kind of Italian food has no garlic? The baked ziti was overcooked and dry, and it was tasteless according to my fiance. \n\nService was slow, but there was only one waitress in the restaurant. I requested warm water and it took about 40 minutes until she finally served it. She was generally nice and probably embarrassed for serving such crappy food.\n\nHow much did it cost us? $50, including tip.\n\nThis restaurant was probably good back in the day.

That being said, the one thing Giant Eagle (GE) has going for it is the quality and selection of items. There is no question that it has everything you could want. That's where the praise ends. Let's just do this numerically...\n\n1. Prices are outrageous. If you walk 100 yards over to the Target next to it, you'll find some of the same items for 30-40% cheaper. A bag of Gevalia coffee is $7.99 at GE, the same coffee at Target is $4.99. And it's not just coffee, and not just Target. Giant Eagle has little other grocer competition in Pittsburgh. This being the case, if you're not near an Aldi's, Target or Walmart, you have to go to GE for stuff. They're banking on this lack of competition. \n\n2. Parking lots are thrashed every day, all the time. Now, maybe you don't care. But when I go in the morning, they've been open maybe 30 minutes and there are shopping carts littering the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the building. They clearly don't bring them in at the end of the night. They also rarely have any small baskets near the door, you'll need to hunt for one. It's just laziness and a lack of care, on both accounts. They don't care about the appearance of the outside, nor the convenience for the customers. \n\n3. I don't normally mind the self-checkout, but only if I have a limited number of items. If I need a full grocery order, I'm going to have to wait in line for one of the two cashiers working the registers, on a Saturday. The lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious. I'm already paying exorbitant prices, but I also have to ring up and bag my cart full of groceries too? Walmart doesn't even make you do that!\n\nSo that's about it. If you don't mind paying much higher than average grocery prices, ringing and bagging your cart full of groceries and generally being an afterthought as a customer, than Giant Eagle in Waterfront is awesome!", "business_id": "eT5Ck7Gg1dBJobca9VFovw", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-05-14", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "RP4kX4YZDvakqSF25tiuEA", "review_id": "5uZ8_StpG-E7ck9kIiOuwA", "text": "This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.

This store is located next to one of the bike trails that I frequent, hence its convenience despite being fairly far from my apt.\n\nOn the positive side, I appreciate the size of this store and the selection of products.  In terms of size, it's larger than the Shadyside Market District (my normal grocery store, hence my standard of comparison), and I'd say the product selection is very similar.  Unlike the MD, when I've visited, the aisles have seemed fairly empty of customers, which may be due to the times of my visits (usually between 7-8pm), as well as the size of the store.  Because it's not a Market District, the prices are a bit less expensive, which is nice.\n\nOn the negative side, the checkout always seems to take forever due to slow customers and/or employees, despite that I've only purchased a couple of items at a time.  The \"express\" lanes move at the speed of molasses, and the self-checkouts are even worse.  Speaking of which, this store has *way* too many self-checkout lanes (about a third of the lanes), and the non-express ones with the belts are unintuitive.\n\nPrior to tonight, I would have awarded this store a rating of 4 or perhaps even 4.5.  However, checkout tonight was even more of a PITA than it usually is.  None of the normal express checkout lanes were staffed with cashiers, despite that I saw at least one employee loafing around talking to another.  So, I was forced to use one of the many self-checkout lanes.  Normally, I don't mind this, esp. when I'm only purchasing a couple of items, but the empty self-checkout lane that I spotted was one with a conveyor belt, and I couldn't figure out how to use it (not that it mattered, since I had only one item, but the self-checkout lanes must be operated using a very specific procedure--see below).  So, I moved over to one of the express self checkout lanes (similar to those in the Shadyside MD), which I knew how to operate.  However, I still managed to bungle the process since I forgot to scan my one item *before* I put it on the scale that doubles as a bagging station, so I had to wait for one of the ever-so-slow employees to come over and key in an authorization code so I could pay.\n\nI'm not sure if the self-checkout stands that GE uses are standard in the industry, since I've never used them anywhere else, but I *hate* the whole weighing/bagging process.  In order to use the self-checkout stations, each item must be scanned and then placed on the scale, and if the weight isn't correct for any reason (including using your own bag), an employee is summoned to check it.  I assume the intention is to prevent people from shoplifting, but (1) it's a major PITA for both customers and employees; (2) most of the employees (including the one I dealt with tonight) don't care, and just key the code without even looking at the error message explaining why they were summoned; and (3) I doubt most shoplifters pay for any of the items they're pilfering--they most likely just stuff them into their purse, clothes, etc. and walk out!  /rant\n\n3.5 stars.", "business_id": "eT5Ck7Gg1dBJobca9VFovw", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-08-28", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "QaUc-lbQ7mvZ1qKKtkiQYw", "review_id": "TVAXaRAzAJPuq6VPZZb8xA", "text": "I have to thank the bakery, once again for getting me out of a jam!

After 45 minutes the finally inform me that they can't fill it b/c the scrip isn't specific enough (it was for a common antibiotic, nothing complicated). They didn't bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner, just made me wait and wait and wait until I pitched a fit to tell me that they couldn't fill it. It was late and I went to Rite Aid in Sq. Hill with the same exact scrip and they had ZERO issues filling it quickly. WTF? How can it be easy peasy at Rite Aid but Giant Eagle can't even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out?

That is where the good part ends.\n\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\n\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\n\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\n\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \n\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\n\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \n\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\" Well, that didn't happen.\n\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \n\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\n\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\n\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.", "business_id": "3ZVKmuK2l7uXPE6lXY4Dbg", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-08-06", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "Z2HWwo5mIEc8SIVZH0IlfQ", "review_id": "DJlSJTPwrPJuxnxPbWBDnQ", "text": "When I wanted a deck for the back of my home I ended up calling Quaker State Construction.

One of the \"special\" dishes offered tonight consisted of chicken, Yukon Gold potatoes, and some sort of sauce.  YOUKON GOLD?!!  Do you eat those potatoes with rice?  My order of Singapore noodles had French fried onions on top.  With curry powder. (I assume it was powder, because the menu promised curry but there was no sauce.)\n\n     The restaurant is half-full on a Thursday night, but noisy with at least three decades of American top-40 music blaring non-stop.  The bar is large, the beer glasses are tall and thin, but there's not  a Tsing Tao or plum wine in sight.  This is as US as a place can get.\n\n     But here's the thing:  the French fried onions are crispy and spicy. We order a $5.00 plate of garlic sugar-snap peas and that's exactly what we get:  snap peas stir-fried for not more than two minutes in a little oil, a lot of garlic and probably a pinch of salt.  This is a fresh, simple, tasty treat and it's matched by the broccoli that comes with the broccoli and chicken dish.  The sauce is blandly acceptable, but the broccoli is emerald green and abundant.  \n\n     I hate the PF Chang ritual where they mix their own special sauce for you, as though you are incapable of mixing soy and chili paste yourself.  Worse, it seems to imply that the food they're serving will be so tasteless it will need all the help it can get from this spicy concoction.  But once the wait staff departs, I just ignore the mess and forget my irritation.  Because, much as I hate to admit it, the food, although about as Asian as the plastic chop sticks they distribute, is fresh, tasty and well-presented.  The staff remembers to re-fill the water glasses.  I'd love to give this place two starts but I keep going back, so I have to give it three, or I'm a chump.  But I'll be damned if I call it an Asian food restaurant.\n\nP.S.    I probably must mention that Ben Roethlisberger was coming in to PF Changs just as I was leaving.  With a good-looking woman.

Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell \"General Tso's\" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.

There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\n\nCoca Cola\nIced Tea\nPan fried pork dumplings\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\nChangs chicken with white rice\n\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\n\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\n\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \n\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-11-30", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "oahclh0MZzSuTpRZSH-6Ug", "review_id": "gDF0jHgRPa5dq1yFKo62pg", "text": "Honestly, I'm furious.

There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \"alright\" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\n\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\n\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\n\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese!

I wish I could give 2.5 stars, but I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up today. \n\nThis was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. \n\nWe were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were \"meant to be shared.\" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a \"here's your sauce\" kind of way. I remember thinking, \"That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce.\" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. \n\nForget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were \"meant to be shared\" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. \n\nOverall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. The music didn't fit the ambiance. Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. The restaurant was loud and crowded.

I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.\n\nThe food is typical PF Chang's: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of \"Chinese\" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entr\u00e9es and have never been disappointed.\n\nI've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.\n\nThe only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more.

But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.\n\nSo... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\n\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \"pork\"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\n\nNext came my \"lunch-portion\" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \n\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. \n\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\n\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\n\nI've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \"lunch-portion\" cost was $9.95.\n\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\n\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done.

This was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it. Fast forward to present day and you'd never believe that was ever the case. Chang's is poorly set up as one large open room that's rather noisy. Food came out quickly but was not as good as the Chinese take out we get from sesame inn. Spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass-produced feel to it. Took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later. Normally one of the great thing about getting Chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day!   Another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom.

Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn't come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience. I really can't thank Sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience.

I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\n\nNow, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\n\nService was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\n\nBeer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\n\nI REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\n\nVerdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers.

I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. \n\nMy friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.\n\nPros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door\n\nCons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.

Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!\n\nThe tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.

I say \"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).\n\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\n\nI've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\n\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-23", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}, "user_id": "sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg", "review_id": "IxX2lLnreI2mI-UH-_Kayg", "text": "I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \"nice\" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit.

As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\n\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \n\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\n\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.

Very good app though! \n\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\n\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party...

The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \n\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.

Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). \n\nAs far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. \n\nAlmost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. \n\nAnother item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant.

Unfortunately the reality didn't match the idea of the burger.  The favor of the BBQ never came through and the smoked Gouda flavor was none existent. It was like having a standard old boring burger.  I was very disappointed.  For $14, I would have expected a lot more flavor.  I would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor.", "business_id": "McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-27", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ", "review_id": "l1IOobjEbiqf7r2JXjUxlg", "text": "My visits here are generally pretty consistent.

They admittedly still aren't my first choice food-wise because, by design, they're a pretty generic eatery for the most part, especially compared to other options in the area. Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront, and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isn't the biggest draw anymore.\n\nThat said, their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying. Plus, they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food, and that deserves a mention. Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven. \n\nI was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.\n\nAdd in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks.

Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place.

The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating.

They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \n\nWhen my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\n\nThe food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.\n\nBar: 1 Star\n\nDrinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\n\nArcade: 4 Stars\n\nThere are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\n\n\nOverall: 3 Stars\n\nIf you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-29", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA", "review_id": "WdMgHwi0-R8Tj3gMqMIFAQ", "text": "Chuckie Cheese for grown ups...Yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but I'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).\n\nFirst let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.

You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.\n\nThe building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\n\nSpeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.

First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo.

The games were down for about 20 mins after the outage and staff was not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the games would be working again.  After the outage, two people in our groups could not get their power cards to work. When we asked staff for assistance they just brushed us off and said we must have been out of credits.

After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends.

Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. \n\nI'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\n\nThe food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)\n\nDrinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \n\nThe prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \"cost\" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.\n\nOverall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. \n\nI can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-03-27", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "Q3F_FZ8pbdRNoSv0X1Y7sA", "review_id": "qM6afyD5OmP-Y7IbefcUQQ", "text": "Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.\n\nThe main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.\n\nYour visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.\n\nThe staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. \n\nNote the \"drinks are weak\" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. \n\nAlso note the \"prize center games suck\" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). \n\nThe thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.\n\nThis review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.\n\nUsing survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.\n\nI really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional.

After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks.

Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \"Are you working?\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down.

I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games.

Wrong! Only thing that was really good was the Corona-rita - but that's hard to mess up. \n\nFirst off, service was horrible. I didn't feel like any of the areas were that packed to make the service so slow, but apparently I was wrong. It took about 15 minutes, minimum, to get our first drinks. At least an hour for our food. I have boneless buffalo wings, which are hard to screw up, so mine weren't bad but they weren't the best. My boyfriend had their Philly Cheesesteak and he couldn't finish it. Was SO salty and just not good. For the price of everything, it was not worth it all. Better off going somewhere else in the Waterfront for food and then coming here to play. You'll save $$, time, and frustration! \n\nI guess they are also remodeling their price area so for now there is a make-shift area to cash in your tickets.

It takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a non-existent ticketing attendant.  So we again go off in search of someone to help.  We flagged down a server, who issued us a card ($56 for 375 tokens) and served us a few cocktails (average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny).   \n\nAnd we are off to play some games.  About every third game we tried was broken in some way.  Either the token swipe didn't work or the game itself was messed up.   It also wasn't the cleanest place I've ever seen.  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didn't look as though they'd been wiped from the day before (which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day).\n\nOverall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening (computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc.) and not well maintained or managed at all.

Let me repeat, never again. \n\nThe primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\n\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \"guilty-until-proven guilty\" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\n\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.\n\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \"maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\"  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\n\nThe latest of many \"adventures\" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  \n\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they \"found\" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.

This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, \"There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?\" \n\nTazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?\n\nLet's go in order of importance:\n\nCoffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. \n\nThe coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. \n\nThis is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. \n\nPastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.\n\nAtmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. \n\nObviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, \"we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!\" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.\n\nTazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-05-26", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "dyFP7vRPhUofhQMzID_h_g", "review_id": "XwT463Fed8uvMr31pZaQsA", "text": "This place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park, making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk.

The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \n\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing).

The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \n\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \"main drag\" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day.

Tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood, you'll likely miss it the first drive by. Turning around is worth it.\n\nYes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.  \n\nThe noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.\n\nDecor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.\n\nIced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.\n\nThe food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten.

It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.\n\nI found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.\n\nTheir baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?\n\nI have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-16", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "_GinkIw8tpdWfxG_1j1CdQ", "review_id": "2_UnuPkJzFyvCPCP0MRd9g", "text": "I can remember the time when I used to strictly drink mocha frappuccinos from Starbuck's thinking that it was the be all end all to coffee in my younger teens.

But after we ordered, what really got me angry was that the food took a VERY long time to arrive. We had 2 kids with us and we ordered 2 kids meals, and had asked for those to be brought sooner. After about 25-30 minutes of nothing, I went to the servers (who were just NOT paying attention to us anyway - the main server's name for our table was Angel) and asked where our meals were. One checked with another, who then informed me that they were working on it. \nWhat made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything, telling me that it had only been 5 minutes. Then one of the servers (manager?) tells me that \"ok, may be it's been 10 minutes, but it's coming\". Then I hear some of the servers talking about our orders. The same gentleman then came to our table, sat down next to me and told me that it's only been 10 minutes and that they were working on our order, and tried to give me some explanation about why that's not really a long time at all. It was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time. \nThe food finally arrived about 10 minutes after that. But the food came cold. \nWe were so HUNGRY by that point, we just ate whatever we could. Neither Angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even ONCE. I had to ask for mine, but by that point I was in no mood to take a sip even. \nI paid ($58.20) and I again got the same gentleman who tried (again!) to explain to me that it was just 10 minutes, and that \"given everything, we were within normal limits\". Wow. \nAfter about an hour and half at the restaurant, we all just shook our heads and left. \n\nI have written to them on their website, and will see if they follow up. \n\nWe have vowed NEVER to go to this restaurant again.

What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.\n\nWhen I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The \"steakburger\" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.\n\nAll this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.", "business_id": "6ilJq_05xRgek_8qUp36-g", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-05-14", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "ltUtdCO_VuaB_LrPsYWigg", "review_id": "x8DzS_VPGxnZlwcyj41Tew", "text": "You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness.

I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \n\nAfter having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!).

After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....\"You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \"bathroom break\", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant.

I peeled back the sheets and noticed tons of little black spots on the pillows and sheets.  The closer I looked I realized there were tiny smears of blood all over the sheets, too.  That alarmed me because those are sure signs of bed bugs.  So I peeled back the fitted sheet and OMG!!!!  Dead dried bed bug carcasses, bed bug poop, blood splotches all lined the entire length of the mattress.  not exaggerating.\n\nI had the misfortune of living in an apartment building once that became infested with bed bugs after I bought a used mattress off Craigslist.

WTF.\n\nI begged for my money back and explained that proir to check in I only had $100 in my bank account and spent half of it on the room and did not have enough money left to go to another hotel.  And asked repeatedly to PLEASE get my money back for a room that I had NOT EVEN USED and JUST purchased 10 minuted prior. The clerk refused and toted their beloved \"Health Department Approval Certificate\"  how in the hell they got it---I dont know.  Had to be fake.   She called me a liar and said there were no bed bugs and no one else has complained.  I practically begged her to walk to the room with me so I could show her the obvious HUNDREDS of bed bugs infesting the entire room.  Her response?  .....\"  Oh Im not going out there, its cold! \"  .....These are the kind of people were dealing with folks.

What impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn't ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.

There was no pressure.\n\nThe amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.\n\nAnd, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  \n\nThat said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  \n\nCustomer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.\n\n\nEdit, 4 years later: \n\nGlen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.  My lowend Trek road bike now has more miles on it.  :-)\n\nIt's still a much longer drive to get to Big Bang, but for any work on my bike, I'm glad to make the drive.

I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\"S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \"Should be ready in a few days\". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \"duke it over\" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles.

Since it was covered under warranty, BBB switched it out for a new set of shifters, at no cost to me.  I had my bike back in a couple days, no muss no fuss.\n\nMy husband got a used road bike from Craigslist, and we brought it in for a tuneup.  The bike had several things wrong with it, due to a shoddy assembly job, and BBB basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it, cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits.  I can't remember the total cost of this, but it was under $100.\n\nI would totally recommend BBB, due to their general awesomeness.

I've never had a pedicure before, mostly because I'm super-ticklish, but I felt like it was about time.\n\nThe salon looks quite nice inside; wood (well, laminate) floors, clean decor, and four pedicure chairs up on the platform on the right. I didn't have an appointment, and waited about ten minutes on a Wednesday evening.\n\nNancy was my nail technician, and she greeted me warmly and helped me over into the pedicure area. Pro tip: Don't wear a past-knee-length skirt, as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward. Nancy helped me out like a pro and I was all set.\n\nThe pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the Migun massage tables. They don't just vibrate; they knead. The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. The foot bath was nice and warm. I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.\n\nNancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.\n\nThis is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.\nEND TMI\n\nEven though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. Polish on and all done! At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.\n\nThe manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.\n\nThe polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.\n\nAgain, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.\n\nThey also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art. I'm not sure if they do waxing. I am sure that it's a friendly place, that it's clean (important!), and that they made me feel relaxed even though I was beyond nervous going in.", "business_id": "jTAKV9zLlAjouAKh4Wd7Yg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-23", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "SYoKTIRnopt56BUN-RL4OQ", "review_id": "muYjHT6GFnWIrX5pc2M6rg", "text": "Fair prices but good quality...

My daily commute takes me by the Waterfront every day, so it's easy to pop into this location and check out their newest inventory. Loft does a great job of turning inventory quickly. Every couple weeks, the store has new product with a full clearance section. I'm also signed up for the brand's emails so I know when promotions are going on. They offer 30-40% off the store every month or so (generally around major holidays) and also offer 40-50% off clearance pretty frequently.\n\nI enjoy the layout and store appearance much better than Ross Park and Robinson. Ross Park's store is very bland, and Robinson is currently in a temporary store. Shopping in an environment with bright fluorescent lights and boring white walls is just terrible, so I enjoy the Waterfront's pretty street-side location best.\n\nThe employees at this location are just OK. Sometimes I am cheerfully greeted at the front door but am generally ignored the entire time that I am shopping. I recently had a very attentive sales associate who opened a fitting room for me when my arms were becoming full, but I thought that I noticed someone with a District Manager vibe lurking around, which probably encouraged the associate's motivation. \n\nI actually had a very negative experience at this store during a recent sales event. The event ended at 7pm on a weekday, and I rushed to the store after getting off work. I hurried around the store and jumped into line at 7:02pm. All associates abandoned the registers at 7pm, totally ignoring me and the other two girls waiting in line. When I was finally helped several minutes later, the snippy associate told me that the discount may or may not go through... that corporate determined when the discount was turned off. OK, that's great, but then why did you totally ignore me and your other customers for several minutes? Did you want us to not get the discount? I was appalled by the rudeness of both the associate and a manager I spoke with earlier in the evening, who was equally rude about the sharp end time of the discount. What made the situation much worse is that a good friend of mine was a manager at Loft a couple years ago and told me that ringing up after 7pm would not be a problem. Hah, well it was a problem at the Waterfront location!\n\nThe only reason that I gave Loft 4 stars is because I love the brand, discounts, and quality of product as a whole. The staff at this location is sub-par and do not reflect the brand well. I hope that Loft does not lose customers based on negative customer service experiences....

Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.

This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\n\n20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \"definitely\" put our order in so it \"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?\n\nThe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.\n\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect.

I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-04-23", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "cFZWUEv28HKZIAr4ZMJoRA", "review_id": "_VStn1OldxsCFp5kSQR4uw", "text": "We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie.

And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\n\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie.

Adoption is made easy unless you rent in which case you should probably bring a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to adopt.

While I realize it's more popular to back the more selective (aka \"no-kill\") shelters around Pittsburgh, the \"open door\" policy places the ARL at the top of my list. Where the so-called no-kill shelters can afford to be choosy and accept all-star pets, the ARL will accept any pet, from a private owner, someone who finds a stray, or even the city's animal control. A small, over-extended staff collaborates with a dedicated troop of volunteers, and manages to adopt thousands and thousands of pets each year into family homes. \n\nI have adopted two cats from this shelter, and also participated in the adoption of several friends' pets here, too. The paid staff can be spread a little thin, especially if you come on a Friday afternoon/evening, or a weekend morning. Guess what, lots of people want to adopt a pet on the weekend when they have extra time to help it settle in. So don't be surprised to find crowds of potential adopters and exhausted staff!!! For a quieter experience, try a weekday. For the most intimate pet-finding experience, go during a Steelers game. Seriously, you will have the place to yourself. \n\nIs it sacrilegious to tell you to do anything during a Steelers game? Whoops. \n\nThe ARL lists some of their pets on Petfinder, but I have found that the selection on the adoption floor is often too vast & quick moving for them to keep the profiles online updated -- what I'm trying to get at is this: Don't get super attached to a pet online, because there's a reasonable chance it already has a home. And don't avoid a trip because you don't see anyone you like online. There are more future fur-friends waiting for you at the shelter. \n\nThe staff of volunteers is extraordinary - I adopted one of my cats directly out of a foster home, and the volunteer must have gone out of her way to come to the shelter at my convenience and explain all the in-home habits of my future baby. I had such a positive experience with her, and the shelter. They invite you to send updates and pictures as your new pet adjusts. Yes, the staff & volunteers have a vested interest in the pets and want to know how things go! \n\nThe rates for adoption vary, depending on the season, so if your finances require some help to acquire your new best friend, keep an eye on their website for info about \"sales.\" You can also donate old sheets, towels, pet carriers, and toys for the animals who stay here on their way to permanent homes. I donate a big pile of worn towels and sheets every time i sort my linen closet. They also accept ca$h donations to help keep up with expenses. \n\nMaybe I seem like an over-enthusiastic cheerleader of this place, but the fact is that this organization connected me with two very important cats in my life, and every scratch on my arms, every litter box, and every fur-covered outfit in my life is due credit to their tireless efforts.

It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. \n\nNow I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for \"cat cuddling.\"  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. \n\nThe other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. \n\nI would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!  \n\nJust check it out if you're curious.  You won't regret it!

BUT, I'm very disappointed by their dog trainer/behaviorialist, Lacey. \n\nI have a large papillon (a \"throwback\", as my vet called him), whose previous owners neglected and undersocialized him for the first two years of his life. As a result, he is now extremely fearful when taken outside the home, and he becomes overstimulated and aggressive. I brought him to one of ARL's Saturday small dog classes, but he freaked out, and we were asked to leave. Lacey said she'd be in contact to set up a private class. \n\nShe called a few days later, and we arranged a private class for 6pm on a Wednesday. I made arrangements to leave work early to drive back into the city and get my pup some help! It's hard to anticipate exactly how much traffic there will be on Fifth Ave during rush hour, so I wound up playing it overly safe and arriving 10 minutes early for our class. \n\nAfter a few minutes, Lacey noticed us and came outside to tell me that she was running fifteen minutes behind. I wasn't sure what to do, because I couldn't really go anywhere with my cray-cray dog, and there was too much traffic to go home and come back again. So, she said we could wait inside in a small hallway. \n\nWe went in to wait, and naturally, with all the smells and sounds, my pup got a bit riled up. But, we waited...and waited and waited. At 6:25pm, I knocked on the door to the training room. Silence. So, I opened it. Nobody was there, and the door to the outside was open. I peeked out, and there she was, with the people and dog that had the lesson before me. I waited for a moment, hoping she'd notice me and look at her watch or something, but nope.\n\nSo, I took my dog and walked outside to my car. She turned and looked at me, but didn't acknowledge me in any way. I went and sat in my car with my dog for a few minutes, hoping the other folks, their dog, and Lacey would wrap things up, but no. They just continued on. At 6:35pm, I knew I couldn't wait any longer, because I had work I still needed to finish up that had to be done by 9pm. I got out of my car, and began walking towards Lacey. She just stared at me, rather than saying \"We're just finishing up,\" or \"Sorry, I lost track of time,\" or anything at all. So I said, \"We're going to have to reschedule. It's past 6:30 now, and I can't stay past 7.\" She simply replied, \"Okay. I'll call you.\" \n\nI thought it was rude and unprofessional to not offer any type of apology, or even a half-hearted explanation, but whatever. No one said she had people skills, I suppose, and this was about getting my dog help! \n\nWell, it's been a week and a half. No call from Lacey! Needless to say, I'll be finding another, more reliable trainer. I'm just really disappointed, not only in her unprofessionalism, but also her lack of caring about my dog. I barely had any interaction with Lacey, but even if there was something about me she didn't like, she should have cared more about helping a pup that obviously needs it. \n\nI sincerely hope that others have had better experiences, and I hate to knock even a single star off for ARL -- but this Yelp review seems to be my only way of warning others to seek another trainer for their dog behavioral needs! :(", "business_id": "VkFDer80GOrelWALdgNReg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-15", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "N1colY77TPM51Q2HIx46Fg", "review_id": "1er6_Jj5jlpRrxP6QB4Oyg", "text": "I love, love, love my puppy.

While struggling with my horrific grief and having difficulty getting back into life as I once knew it, my grief counselor suggested that I \"help something else\" in order to help myself feel better.  We decided that since I was an animal lover I would try volunteering at an animal shelter.  I was not working, so I had a lot of time and wanted the shelter to feel right.  I visited a few, they all do good work, but the one that kept drawing me back was the ARL.  Yes, the building is old, it's a bit run down, but that doesn't stop the staff and administration from doing the best they can with so very little and in not the best of space.  I saw a bathroom be \"renovated into a vet tech office, I saw the janitor's closet renovated and made in to the \"rodent room.\"  Where cats once lived in cages along the halls of the ARL a new building next door, an old gas station was made into the \"Cat Adoption Center!\"  When you have staff that are still young and are going on 5-10 years + at the same shelter, (same place of employment for that matter) you know something about the place is right!  I volunteer easily 30 hours a week at the ARL, I get to see the good, the bad and the ugly, and I can tell you first hand that the good is in the staff, the Executive Director, Dan Rossi, and all of the work that goes on for the animals.  The staff knows EVERY one of the animals, they do all they can to care for them, and keep the doors WIDE open for both domestic and wild animals, even if that means a staff member or volunteer takes a cat or dog home!  The answer is never ever \"no\" to any animal.  I also volunteer for the Humane Society of the United States and travel around the countryside working on dogfighting raids, cruelty, hoarding, natural disasters, and the ARL has never said no to me when I ask to bring animals back from incredibly sad or inhumane situations.  Technically, by the numbers, it is a \"no-kill\" shelter, because it is open door people will often call it a \"kill shelter.\"  Yes, sometimes an animal does have to be euthanized.  The ARL is the Animal Control shelter for the city of Pittsburgh and with that can bring some very upsetting and disturbing signs of animal cruelty.  It can also mean it's the dog who just bit a kid that you just saw on the news.  The ARL has an obligation to society to not let dangerous dogs back on the street, to euthanize when a dog is very sick or is very aggressive to humans or other animals, and trust me, I have held many of those dogs as they are put to sleep and I always am so thankful that the vet staff we have are so compassionate and do the euthanasia in the most humane manner.  That's a tough job, it's heartbreaking, but in some cases it has to be done for the good of the animal and for the safety of society.  I admire the work and staff of the ARL and will continue to devote my time to them and thank them for the wonderful work they do on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh and all of the wild and domestic animals alike.

I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\n\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\n\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\n\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. \n\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?\n\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\n\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. \n\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.

I think this place is a necessity for the city, and their open-door policy ensures no one will be turned away, saving thousands of animals, but their staff members are some of the most unprofessional and RUDE people I've ever met. When they say that no animal will be euthanized unless it has a health or behavior issue, believe that 'behavior' is a very broad term.  In their own words,  \"Any animal that doesn't tolerate, and also welcome, handling by strangers will be euthanized\".  I found this out when I fostered 5 kittens, and all of the 7 week old kittens were to be put down because they were 'fussy'.  What the hell kitten isn't fussy?!!!! They're curious little guys that want down to explore! \n When I took the kittens in to offer up for adoption, the exam room was right next to a room full of barking and howling dogs.  There was a girl back there howling at the top of her lungs and laughing, I guess she thought it was funny that the dogs were so terrified and distressed?  The tech handled the kittens (that were terrified because of all the noise) very roughly, and shoved them back into the crate, injuring one of them.  When one of the kittens tried to stop herself from being shoved in the crate, it scratched her, and she became very angry, telling me they would all be euthanized for acting this way!  Luckily, the volunteers must have handled them and helped to calm them, because they were able to offer 2 them up for adoption.  If it wasn't for the volunteers, that place would be a hellhole for all those poor babies.\n.\nWhen I took one of the kittens that I ended up adopting (to save them from certain death) to be spayed, the extremely rude tech handed her to me in a box to take home.  After an hour and a half drive home, I opened the box to find my kitten wrapped so tightly in a towel she couldn't move, and she had another towel around her face so tight she couldn't breathe!  I was never so angry in my life!  I don't care how rude you are to me, but do not take it out on the animals!  The poor baby probably hissed or scratched at the tech, so the tech decided to protect herself from the vicious 2 pound kitten by immobilizing her.  \n\nI am now fostering 2 kittens from them that are very sick.  They told me they do better getting well in a home,  Well no doubt, when I got them home, they were FILTHY,  with feces all over their backside, and they weigh less than they did 2 weeks ago when I took them there.  when I asked the 'vet tech' what kind of food they fed them, she said, 'Oh it doesn't matter'.  It most definitely does matter!  Suddenly changing an animals food causes gastic distress, vomiting and diarrhea.  Even the cheapest bag of pet food will tell you that.  That's probably how they got so sick!  I'm actually afraid to complain to anyone until the cats I fostered are adopted, I'm terrified they will hurt the kittens!\n\nI hate to say, \"Don't go here, don't take your animals here\", because then only the animals suffer!  But if you have a bad experience, get names, and write the managers and CEO, and let them know specifics.  Hopefully getting the wrong people out of there.  Starting with the African American receptionist.\n\n\nI'm sure this review will end up with the \"Not recommended\" reviews.

Many of us get here more than an hour before the clinic starts and wait in line. For those of us who have not as well behaved animals, we tag team it and have one person stand in line while the other stays somewhere off to the side with the animal.\n\nHowever, on the July Clinic, one lady claimed to be first because she told a volunteer that she needed to stay in the car with her mom instead of waiting in line. Then when the paperwork was being passed out and those of us in line expressed the fact that she did not stand in line, some of us even having a picture of those of us in line, she repeated the fact that she has an elderly mom. When that didn't suffice, she said she had an agressive dog. While I understand that agressive dogs should not be in close proximity to other animals or humans which they could harm, that doesnt stop others who have less friendly animals to still stand in line and control our pets or have another member of the family stand in line on our behalf. For the ARL to let both individuals and their \"agressive\" dog sit in the car and be taken first is unfair to the rest of the participants. What is even more concerning is that this \"agressive\" dog was allowed to sit in the waiting room for 21 minutes with 10 other owners and their pets, some of us which had more than one pet. If this truely was a case of an agressive animal, then the ARL did a disservice to its first 10 Vaccine Clinic participants who were in the waiting room. In addition, the release form states that agressive animals will not be tollerated. \n\nIt would be one thing if this was a one off, but then someone came in claiming to have an apt for a vaccine booster at 930 even though they don't schedule appointments on Sundays except for SPAY day, and they took him!\n\nIf any one knows what I need to do or say to get preferential treatment in the future, please let me know! I get that this is a low cost clinic where the services are provided at cost and I greatly appreciate  that because it helps me care for my animals and the rescues we have at a reasonable cost. However, I shouldn't be punished or forced to wait because others cannot follow directions.

I've found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine. \n\nSapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pike's hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don't let the location fool you. Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere. There's a bar at the front, some tables to the right, and the main dining area to the left. There's also that karaoke machine I've never seen used in all the years I've gone here.\n\nUnlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren't all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it's all about the food, which is fine by me. I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it's fun to look like a goofball while trying, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe food here is excellent. They've introduced a new look to their menu recently. I don't know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I'm not sure if they're using it for anything other than just what's on the main menu, which would be a shame if so, as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I'm not aware of.\n\nAt any rate, the starter soup and salad is great. I love the bits of onion in the soup. It's a very strong broth, but not overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love it, but I tend to like it everywhere I've had it, so I'm not a real stickler when it comes to that.\n\nUsually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it's a great dish. I've also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well.\n\nNow, my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the \"magic sauce.\" It's of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I'm always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don't have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn't come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it's a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.\n\nSo if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It's amazing. Use it for your steak or chicken as well. I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli. I don't care for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.\n\nSapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn't have them as well. I think they were doing fine without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, if unnecessary.\n\nThe steak here is great. I've had the sirloin as well as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. All around, you get a great meal here for the price.\n\nI'm not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore. Sapporo's a funny place in that some weeknights you'll drive by and it's packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I'd suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds. Yet even when it was \"packed\" I've never had to wait long to be seated at a table.\n\nSo if you haven't been, give Sapporo a try. It's been there forever. The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit. They don't do lunches anymore, so it's strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least 20-30 dollars on up for adults, and around 10 or so for kids' meals. It's not some place you would go frequently if you're on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go.", "business_id": "8Nm_jcCYtMXYW0ODSHDiXA", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-26", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw", "review_id": "FxcalYSYxfrA9AOJq3xEzA", "text": "Been to many hibachis, this one is very clean, the building is a little older but the family that runs it does a wonderful job. \n\nI came here and got the chicken.

On the one hand, there are plenty of waterslides/pools that are a good fit for young \"riders\", on the other hand, Sandcastle, like any city amusement park, attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood.  \n\nUnfortunately that element doesn't particularly care about \"censoring\" speech for 9 year old ears, and worse, in the Mon Tsunami, about personal space, since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and 'showing off' for the fairer sex, and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.\n\nHaving said that, it's still a good day at the park. . . cheese fries, a cool dip in the pool on a hot day, some fun slides. . . \n\nI think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park.

I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\n\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\n\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \n\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\n\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. \n\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground.

I have to keep telling myself that when I want to complain about this place.  I DO think it's a great place to take the fam or even, in my case, spend a day relaxing... if you can!  \n\nLet's do the compliment sandwich.  Positive - negative - positive!  \n\nThe negative... I feel like Sandcastle is the forgotten redheaded stepchild of Kennywood.  They keep pouring money into K-wood, but Sandcastle stays the same year after year.  Now, granted I haven't been there in YEARS, but everything seemed the same as I left it other than one new slide.  I haven't been there in about 9 years.  One new slide in 9 years?  Hmmmmm....\n\nI see major places to improve.  Especially the pool.  I honestly think the slides are great, although you could always add more, they're still fun.  The pool... it's just packed.  So packed that you'd think they'd add a second pool.  Looking around it looks like they have the extra space.  Maybe an adults only pool?  Swimming with 20 zillion kids, plus adults drinking (yes I like that you can bring your bevvie in the pool... but it's kinda weird being around so many kids) and you start to wonder how clean the water is.  I mean, 20 zillion kids you gotta expect a good amount of kiddos are peeing in the pool!  \n\nThe sidewalks are also scalding hot.  I'd assume since many of the people are walking around barefoot you'd be able to custom order some kind of non sun absorbing surface.  And I\"m NOT investing in those dorky water shoes, sorry!  \n\nI'm ALWAYS happy to see a Potato Patch stand!  Just as good as K-wood!  They also serve chicken tender, which is nice if you want a little meat to add on.  Nothing more is needed for me!  Although the frozen drinks looked tasty and tempting, it was so hot out I was just downing water by the gallons.  You're also allowed to bring in your own snacks and food, which I think is nice for families who want to save a little mola.  \n\nAgain, Sandcastle is so awesome to have in the Burgh, it would be nice to see improvements.  It always seems packed in the summer months, so why not keep on improving it?  Or maybe they think don't fix what's not broken.

My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me \"Stay out of trouble\".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.

It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.\n\nI do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money!

They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck.

I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\n\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\n\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \n\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \n\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \n\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \n\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \n\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\n\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.

But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \"mistake\" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-02", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "tx4XvjDlactzL7SlNnR9XQ", "review_id": "5b5WisVblTVpl8qYVCi5Yg", "text": "This is a regular go-to for me.

I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.

While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.\n\nPeople ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.\n\nHard to tell if the deserts were \"homemade.\"  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. \n\nOn the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J's.  \"A-ok\" probably is the best way to describe it.", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-12", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "3_MuuYvWx7h5GgfCtfrZiA", "review_id": "5LH6Q4H0S5TEOBSXgBTztg", "text": "Service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are \"just\" working .

I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy.

I really don't understand why more people don't go here. \nMy favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table. \n\nAlso, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js.

First, the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown Carnegie's main street. When you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads. It rather looks like a deli counter. You have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area. A bit confusing layout, but tastefully done. The dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant. It felt much more upscale once in the dining area, but I did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique. \n\nThe food - A wide range of Italian dishes and seafood. We ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer. It was an average serving of lump crab meat, I had to ask for cocktail sauce. It was tasty, but cost us $18. We then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes, eggplant, peppers, etc. There were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp. $28. There was no salad or pasta side offered. The dish was prepared properly and was OK. We just felt it needed something else. \n\nNow the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads. The pepperoni bread was AMAZING! I mean really delish. This alone I would have given 5 stars. \n\nThe service - Our server was...well....I'm not sure what he was quite frankly. Annoying?Confused? Hyper?  He appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time. Bouncing around the table, asking the same questions over and over, forgetful, spastic, etc. At one point one of my colleagues said, \"Is he on crack?\" We chuckled, but seriously! He forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert, which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving.\n\nOverall - If I were in the area again I would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go, as they do sell it by the loaves. However, I think I would try somewhere else to dine.", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-07", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "xMB0XrFRuQr6mJtNzz_a8Q", "review_id": "jRYZZvfGiZqUhgwTwiWppQ", "text": "Many trips to Pittsburgh over 20 years.

This was the first time we've been to this restaurant. We usually stop a Riley's Pour House across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different.\n\nThe place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside. It was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar. The traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell that's why it was one of the last tables available. But our waitress came by promptly, got us drinks (I had a Hoegaarden and my girl ordered an Absolute water and cranberry), gave us menus and recited the specials of the day.\n\nAfter viewing the menu for a bit, I decided on the Veal Parmigiano; my date went with one of the specials, a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish. The plates took about 15 minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous... enough for a filling lunch the next day. My veal was tender and delicious but it's really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression. You could tell that it was house made; it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite. I never tasted gnocchi like it before.\n\nOver all I give PaPa J's a big thumbs up. The food was good, most of the dinning area's seemed cozy, the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance. Although I thought it was a bit pricy, I didn't feel as if I've been taken.  Other than the location of our table, it was the pre-theater perfect meal.

We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. Our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling).\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup.\nThe side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. I would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.\n \n  We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to \"put it in\". He offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to. \n \n  The main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful, but not as expected.\nThe chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. It had no signs of being coated and saut\u00e9ed  to a rich golden brown. The chicken was just pale white.\nThe sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. I tasted no garlic or shallots. The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  No pasta was served with the chicken. The side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.\n\n  Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. The total was $43 and change.\nI would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and \nI saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary.\nI am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.

Was trying to go to a different place. Glad the Pizza Gods were looking out for me. Ordered a caesar salad with anchovies and a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The salad was fresh and excellent. Dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch. There is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones. There was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount. The large salad was more that enough for my wife and I. They serve a bread basket with two styles of bread. Pepper cheese and a standard Italian with a harder crust. They were both so good I purchased a loaf of each on the way out. Price per loaf was only $4. No way they make profit on the Pepper Cheese Loaf. Best value in bread in quite some time. I will stop in for the bread whenever I am in the area. The Pepper Cheese I would rate a 9.5 out of 10. The Italian was as good as it gets. I am a Pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough. I am so tough I do not review if I think its bad. There Pizza is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place. I would ask for a little less sauce. I would call it almost NY Style. Slightly thicker crust.

After about 15 minutes or so she finally did make it back to our table.  For my dinner entree I decided on having the Romano chicken.  It came out a short time later with a side of broccoli.  The chicken had a nice golden color to its breading and tasted pretty good although a bit salty.  I can take at least some credit for that though as I may have used the Parmesan that was on the table quite liberally.  Meanwhile the broccoli was over cooked for my tastes and seemed mushy whenever I bit into it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.

First, I'll walk you through my experience. \n This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! \nI couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). \n\nI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  \nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.", "business_id": "kKmvSJ6Z8UVPdrnL74bqrg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-04-15", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "r03q28rqlF0YY-7WW027Cg", "review_id": "8KE5OYgLeVNfw4tkvQ-sdg", "text": "Woo Hoo!

You're never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you've just bought.\n\n2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. \n\n3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.\n\n4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.

I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited.\n\nThe clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue.

Getting out is a bear if you're heading back towards the city, like I usually am, because to pull up to the traffic light you have to go the wrong way through the very narrow parking area in front of the store. Crossing three lanes on 51 without the help of a traffic light just seems like a bad plan.\n\nOnce inside the store, beware of other customers on the weekends. I've encountered aggressive shoppers on multiple occasions who are usually welding carts as weapons.

Here's my rant, a friend and I stopped in one day after high school. I was a senior at a catholic private school at the time so I was required to wear a fancy uniform so I looked highly presentable. I picked a shirt up I was thinking of getting and held it as we browsed through the store. They announced they were closing and I was across the store from where I got the shirt. Deciding not to get it, I placed it on a near by shelf. My friend checked out, and as we were walking out of the store a  woman that worked there said to me \"where is the shirt you were holding\". I told her I had placed it on the self in the back, and said sorry for not putting it back. She said \" I walked back there and didn't see it, so where is it\" and clearly implied that i stole it.  I told her again that it was on the shelf as nice as I could and she then told me that she didn't believe me and told me to go back there and get it or else she was going to search me. Now I get that it doesn't matter that the shirt was 50 cents because stealing is still wrong but because I didn't steal it and told her so I feel Im justified in being furious that I was publicly humiliated and falsely accused over 50 cents. I walked to the back of the store picked it up and started walking back and then the lady said in a grossly rude tone \" well I didn't see it back there\" no apology, no nothing.

He told me good luck and that I'm liable to just be careful because everywhere is icy. After two years at this gym I'm fed up with the way they treat their customers. He told me he was fed up with me since I gave him a hard time about being out of towels a few weeks ago (which they've had towels since then). They never clean the parking lot in the winter so make sure you wear boots outside and don't crash your car. Aside from that, this gym is well just that a gym. My biggest critic (aside from rude management and negligence) would have to be that they don't encourage sanitization outside of the cardio room. There aren't towels and spray around the weight machines, which I've never had an issue with, but I'd hate to see that happen. I always make sure to at least wipe off my sweat marks from the machine, cause well that'd be pretty nasty. It is pretty large in terms of size and space to do anything aside from the ordinary weights and cardio. The workers well they're mostly young and don't really care too much (the man who told me I was wrong was older and possibly a manager or owner). They tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towels even when it isn't busy, which can be pretty annoying. Their cardio room always has Fox News on two tvs and then the middle TV has sports center on regardless of what else is on tv. They recently haven't even been putting pens games and stuff on. Must be too busy watching the 52 inch screen they have in the lobby for the workers while the cardio room has max 32 in the middle and 24 on the sides probably. If I had to pay full price for my membership I probably wouldn't belong here, but it's through my insurance. That said I don't swipe my card like most people in the front on my own. The machine is behind the counter. One guy always shows me how to do it myself, which was helpful the first time cause people aren't always around the front desk. That said when he is standing behind there chatting I would expect him to do it since it's his job. This gym is nothing state of the art fancy fancy, but do you really need a fancy looking gym? Their cardio room is pretty massive and even at peak hours I've never had a problem getting a treadmill or elliptical. They actually even have two hellix trainers, which aren't super common yet. Sometimes when things go out of order they take a while to fix them. I've run into the owner or manager one time in the bathroom when someone let a sink over floor and asked if I should tell the guys at the desk and she said oh no they're useless. This gym makes a killing from a) classes b) it's convenient and c) their personal training is a separate company (warrior fitness).

After 8 rings someone picked up the phone and mumbled at me. I cheerfully asked how much the car wash was.\n \n-\"We can't give that information over the phone\". \n--\"Wait, what!? Why not?\" \"I just want to know to compare it to Getgo's, which is $7\". -\"Sorry.\" \n--\"Well that's stupid; let the manager know I think he's an idiot.\" \n-\"Sure\". Click.\n\nSo come for the ebola laced bathroom, stay for the nihilistic attitudes!", "business_id": "w8N1BIB2MiP53PM7ouYPQQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-02-23", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "RSExP0-Boucr4QyIEzZi0A", "review_id": "gSzaLOeX8d6Wf_okxP2Vtg", "text": "Just like with the Get-Go down the road, the Shell on Baum is almost just as difficult to get in and out of- particularly in high traffic.

Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \"pies\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \"they were out\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card.

A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. \n\nDuring my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!\n\nBottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood. \n\nBut do bring cash. The don't take credit cards. Believe it or not, they WILL actually take a check.", "business_id": "ucKQlQvOeJxETLNkpKcaSw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-10-13", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "whQ58mCDvg_cFROfib6TiQ", "review_id": "h77yiz5Kyubu-45mwds9mw", "text": "On our recent visit to Pittsburgh my family and I had breakfast at the Rusty Nail in Bellevue (dad's hometown).

Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\n\n1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.\n\n2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   \n\n3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\n\n4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\n\n5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\n\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.\n\nAlso, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\n\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.

I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.

'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\n\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \n\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \n\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\n\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\n\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food.

I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!

I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.\n\nThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\n\nSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great.

When we walked in the singing we heard was NOT good. Oy was it not good... Thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.\n\nSo there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.\n\nThey played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn't know it (like Toxic) they'd find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.\n\nPart of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.\n\nMy friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.\n\nIf in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. Having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun.", "business_id": "MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-08", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "MJnIMhzm4onnjtzyprVXJA", "review_id": "emGY8AzjqZ3Tmp4tGyL2Kg", "text": "While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we'd see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It's apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.\n\nSing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB's in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV's, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn't a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I'd say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.\n\nThis particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE's party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.\n\nThere were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto's Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV's \"Growing Pains.\" I was sold from that point on.\n\nI will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I'm not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn't bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.\n\nDrinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn't brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn't scary and I'm not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there. \n\nThe only down side to everything was group seating as you're sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives. \n\nOoops!\n\nAll and all a good time and someplace I'd certainly return to if for any reason I'd be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car.", "business_id": "MKyk4F4HSzHF8v-4cYe3Ww", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-17", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "_vS9qNQvx8wVUOIkj4qfAg", "review_id": "39g2XybQLeCqDwas70SZdQ", "text": "In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it.

The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.\n\nBut today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song you're the piano man has run it's course. I don't hate Sing Sing, but I could never come here more than once a year.

It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. \n\nIt was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \"Rubber Ducky\" and \"Gangsta's Paradise\" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \"anything else,\" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \"yinz\" instead of \"you.\"\n\nI saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. \"I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\" he said when she requested him.\n\nThere were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\n\nLuckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\n\nSing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbr\u00e4uhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion.

I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  \n\nInside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \n\nOne random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \n\nNot only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.

I've also had the raspberry filling and would recommend that as well. They are incredibly creative with their decorating of the cakes including wedding cakes but if you want something specialized (nonstandard icing, etc) be sure to call ahead and place your order in advance.

I've ordered them for bridal showers or just stopped by to pick one up for myself. They are the perfect size for one person (if you aren't on a diet). They do sell out of these so place an order ahead of time if you want a large order or stop by early in the morning to make sure you can get them. \n\nI've gotten cookies from here and they were average.

I also sampled the tiramisu which was delicate with just a hint of espresso and the cream was perfect.

Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  \n\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \n\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \"chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\"  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \"drizzling\" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\n\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \n\nThe \"numero uno\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  \n\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \n\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?

Reading the other reviews, it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant I was.  Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.\n\nWe were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  \n\nMy fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a \"baked potato pizza\" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.\n\nOverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-02-05", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "2qp-XuRq7w73yL4uyGg6-Q", "review_id": "a9BhIKXow0PAoK4NtKTQKQ", "text": "My girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last Saturday.

I was seated right away, no wait. Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers. Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. \n\nNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.\n\nBottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are.

This place is such a great hangout/eat-in spot. I hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.\n\nWe arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches. \n\nAfter ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.\n\nI'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. \n\nWe came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come. \n\nOnly down side is slow service. It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked.

I love everything about crunch crust, a nice rich tomato sauce, and a thick layer of melted cheese. I have never tried Chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles, Uno's was right there so we decided to try it out. \n\nOnly a 30 minute wait for a Saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the Waterfront. We were seated at a booth in the bar area. The tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished. Only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. Good news, only happened twice!\n\nThe four of us decided to order two pizzas, the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market. I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life.  \n\nThe salad. It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend. The croutons were huge and very crunchy. The Caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a \"bite\" to it as Chris kept on saying. I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am I to say.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested. \n\nThe main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining. Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. But!!!! I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection. \n\nThe Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris' extra from his plate. The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them. It was a really really good pizza. We even ended up taking slices home with us! My eyes deceived me at first with the size! \n\nThen our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. This cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. WARM, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. Oh sweet heavens, it was good. I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness. \n\nChicago Pizza, I would absolutly try again.", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-01-06", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "NnwZ8e5lfSPX605dz5QAoA", "review_id": "awNqS2p9G4tSEbZx-j5ctA", "text": "I had the deep dish pizza and it was very good!

I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza.

You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.\n\nOh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi.

No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever.

Pierogies Plus is so legit. \n\nThe setting is reminiscent of Seinfeld's 'Soup Nazi': tiny interior, people standing in line shoulder-to-shoulder, and a lady behind the counter brusquely taking orders.

I opted for the sauerkraut pierogies, and they were SO good! The interior was filled with sauerkraut mixed with potatoes, as opposed to many other sauerkraut pierogies I've had that were filled with only kraut. I definitely prefer the potato/kraut mix! They were also drowning in butter and onions. Like, serious, serious butter - Paula Deen has nothin' on these ladies' butter usage. The kielbasa was awesome, too! I also sampled their haluski and it was the best I've ever had. Tons o' butter, seasoned with generous amounts of salt 'n' pepper, and there was quite a bit of saut\u00e9ed onions in the mix, which added even more flavor. \n\nA few things to note: They have coupons you can print out on their website, but you must cut them out if you're gonna bring 'em in and use them! You cannot just hand them the whole piece of paper. If you want to order a special variety, they need 2 days advance notice (check their site to see what the 'special' ones are). They do accept credit cards, with a $10 min. Yes, some of the ladies are not the friendliest, but the food is so good, they can be like that, and you'll still come back for more!

The Improv is a great venue for upcoming and new comedians, I always see new, local talent opening for national comedians. In one show you will see 1-2 local comedians, and 1-2 national touring comedians. The Improv has a nice environment inside with general admission seating (first come, first serve). The EMAIL LIST is essential in order to receive free ticket packages and perks, as well as reminders of upcoming comedians!\n\nCons: Prices can be steep (it is expensive/difficult to be a regular). Food and Drinks are not cheap (no specials). Expect to pay $15- $40 for tickets depending on the headliner with a two item minimum. Waiting in line before the shows wouldn't be bad if you weren't forced to stand outside in any and all weather conditions. If it is raining and you'd like a good seat, you will pay the price. \n\nOverall: This 21+ venue is a great place to spend a night out with friends or loved ones. You may buy tickets in advance online/phone or buy your tickets at the box office at the location. I highly recommend joining the mailing list to receive free tickets!

The food, however.  Blah.\n\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    \n\nSecond, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. \n\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    \n\nOverall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-09", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "8syjbjJRkzxK9RUaKewUrg", "review_id": "SwrlnLby5YNCMo8IYBGzIg", "text": "The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\n\nThe setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\n\nIt's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\n\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\n\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\n\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \"Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\"  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.\n4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask \"would you like a refill on that?\" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \"would you like another one?\" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \"we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.\"  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-09-05", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "vFgVosI6MUPX8Y23hmuMXw", "review_id": "FaH9I3K9VkdjRLZfXv_xGg", "text": "I love the Improv.

I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us.

The improv is a great place to go for a good show a few times a year. The venue is clean. The comedians are good, for the price, and many times you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price (i.e.Tommy Johnagin). However, be advised, if you attend more than one show every couple of months, you will see some of the same opening acts repeated. This is my biggest gripe with the Improv. I've been to the Improv about 3 times over the past 4 months and have seen the same opening acts a few times. I think they cycle through the same 4-5 comedians. Are there not more talented comedians in Pittsburgh? As noted in other reviews, another area of improvement is the drinks and food. I always attend the late showing so that I can eat elsewhere. The food is mediocre bar food at best. Nothing more needs to be said about that. I definitely don't mind the two drink minimum. I've been known to consume more than two drinks in one setting but, the drinks are insanely overpriced. $5 for a Miller Lite, $4 for a Snapple, $10 for a fountain drink with refills. You're better off having your two drinks during the show and going over the Sing Sing after for a draft .  . or four.

We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \n\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \"event\". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\n\nMy car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.\n\nThe Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv.

People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom.

That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.\n\nSo I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.  Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks.  We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...\n\nSo the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  \n\nThe one or two things I didn't like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?

My husband and I went to see one of our favorite comedians on a Thursday night. There is a two-item minimum, so we decided we would just eat dinner at the show. Well, we were mistaken. First of all, our waitress was rude and slow. After sitting there for 5 or 6 minutes without service she finally comes over and asks what we want. We both order a drink and food, to which she tells us that the kitchen caught on fire earlier that day so all they have are salads and desserts. I was annoyed that she even asked what we wanted instead of starting out with this important fact.\n\nAt any rate, I order a Caesar salad and a beer. It comes out and it's iceburg lettuce with shredded cheese, tomatoes, and other veggies. In other words, a regular salad. I inform the waitress of this and she seemed totally confused. I suppose she did not understand the difference, which was odd. \n\nOverall, I felt that there was no apology for the fact we couldn't eat, let alone everyone else in the place. Salad or dessert aren't the greatest choices when you are expecting to eat dinner at the show. I think the Improv should have waived the two-item minimum on this occasions, even if it cost them money. \n\nAfterwards, I emailed the Improv with my concerns. Never. Heard.

I saw Sheryl Underwood and she was fantastic. It was my first time being at the Improv. After years of saying that I wanted to go, it really did meet my expectations! The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place. We were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating, though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first. The seating is layered in tiers. Each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating. It was very comfortable, roomy and an interactive set up. The stage is close to the seating (some tables are right at the stage) with little space between you and the comedian, which made it very interactive and fun. We arrived at the Improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm, with doors opening at 10:00 pm. We waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm, so they were really behind schedule. The show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act. The show was over around 1:00 am. The only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that I have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu. ($30/ticket isn't enough?) I was not hungry and did not want to drink, so this was a bit frustrating, especially because it wasn't disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else. The server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I got away getting 3 drinks for the night. The food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable, though if you want water you are looking at $5 for Fiji or sparkling. It was $8 for a glass of wine. $11 for bottomless soda, complete with a take home Improv glass. The other thing that I didn't like was that an employee takes your tickets while you're waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker. After one bathroom trip, the mark was gone, so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase. These negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most certainly go back! It is a fun place where you are guaranteed to have a good time with a lot of laughter!", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-10-11", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "Z2V1WiOtxbjNv4XZuakR8A", "review_id": "HFRMznZYf_0lGqPZm0-c2w", "text": "So...we got here and seated by 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now it is 752pm. One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. I had\nMy shrimp diablo. It was as described. Spicy and good!!! But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. We also sent an order of chicken fingers back...dryer than sand. And my fianc\u00e9s chicken Caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers. Barely edible, in fact, she didn't eat more than 3 pieces of it.

I hate this place's M.O. The space itself is fine...only a few blind spots, nice intimate venue. They bring decent acts in, although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts. But the two item minimum just infuriates me. Overpriced, shitty food and drinks. We went to see Lachlan Patterson last night (hilarious show, very nice guy, signed our CD and posed for photos with people). We dropped $40 on a chicken quesadilla, 6 hot wings, and 2 Yuengling drafts. The whole time I just sit there thinking about all the amazing places I COULD have eaten for $40. Burgatory is right down the street. Hell, TGI Friday's would have been better. I've been to other comedy places in other cities and they often have minimums but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality.  The Improv's saving grace is that they often have free or very cheap tickets.", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 2, "date": "2015-02-01", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "ix4BCj1a3Q56A-bZBmW2kw", "review_id": "R2XjSTfiYouvLipiCdA4-g", "text": "The food is why I give them three stars.

Tickets say seating begins at 9pm for the 9:30pm show.  Well, a line had formed outside because they hadn't opened the doors.  That is all well and good if it is summertime but it was 4 degrees.  People stood out there upwards of 20 minutes, freezing.  They didn't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready.  Seating is first come, first served.  Whoever designed this place should be shot.  There is no lobby to hold people before a show.  The Improv in Cleveland is superb.  That location has a huge lobby and bar where you can mingle before the show and they have ushers seat you.  The Pittsburgh Improv is a disaster layout-wise.  Beverage service was fine.  It got really, really warm in the room and even the comedian was sweating like a freak show.  Of course Bret and Bill Crawford were as hilarious as ever but man, this Improv, as a comedy venue, sucks.", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-02-15", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "f3z4VItrhUYgvIIEXdavxw", "review_id": "Uk3F5wwJgFMpZ2g95QiFNQ", "text": "We've been to the improv comedy club twice now and both shows were amazing; even the opening acts! \n\nThe only downfall is the two drink minimum, which I understand, but their prices make it ridiculous. We stuck to beer because we knew it wouldn't be watered down. Our waitress was horrible. We did not have an opportunity to order our second drinks until the other waitresses were bringing out checks. If our waitress was more attentive, the club could have made more money off of us. Oh well. \n\nI would recommend eating at a restaurant before the show because the food menu is limited and overpriced. \n\nThe only other thing I'm not a fan of is the seating. We were fortunate enough to get there early and have the back of a booth. The last few people who arrived got the turned around seats in front of us. I feel that the club should invest in long, thin tables like bars have so everyone has a surface to put their food or drinks. \n\nOverall, we love the comedians so we'll definitely be back.", "business_id": "tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-03-07", "type": "review"}, {"votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ", "review_id": "qUQhqpIG12RVl40HzcvmYw", "text": "Nice little venue for quality fun.
